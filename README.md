# üöÄ Internship1Project ‚Äì IDMS InfoTech

üëã Hi, I'm **Kaustubh Deshpande**  
This is my internship assignment submission for **IDMS InfoTech**. It‚Äôs a UI/UX-focused Android app developed using **Jetpack Compose** and **Material 3**. The project showcases my skills in layout structure, responsive design, and interface customization.

## ‚ú® Screens & Enhancements

### üñºÔ∏è 1. App Icon Screen
- ‚ùå **Issue**: The existing screen follows phone‚Äôs theme inconsistently.
- ‚úÖ **Improved**: Consistently uses a **light theme** regardless of system settings.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è 2. Splash Screen
- ‚ùå **Issue**: Trademark appears after text.
- ‚úÖ **Improved**: Trademark is **static** while text **animates and fades out smoothly**.

---

### üìä 3. Dashboard Screen
- ‚úÖ Revamped the **Support button**.
- ‚úÖ Ensured the **Punch-out card is scrollable** for better UX.

---

### üìÇ 4. Navigation Drawer
- ‚úÖ Enhanced UI for a cleaner, more **Material 3** feel.
- ‚úÖ Top (header/logout) remains **static**, lower items are **scrollable**.

---

### üé® 5. Other Improvements
- üéØ **Color consistency**: Bottom nav bar and status bar match screen backgrounds.
- üåê **Localization-ready**: 70% of strings moved to `strings.xml`.
- üí´ **Animations**: Subtle transitions for a modern feel.
- üì± **Adaptive layout**: Components scale better across screen sizes.

> "This is my first time building a multi-screen, component-rich app using Compose. It challenged me to think in terms of structure, state, and visual clarity‚Äîsomething I truly enjoyed and plan to keep improving!"
